# 👋 Hi, I'm @loki-smip

### 🚀 Recursive AI Architect & Software Engineer
I am a 14-year-old developer focused on pushing the boundaries of efficient LLM architectures. I specialize in recursive weight-sharing models and high-performance systems.

---

### 🛠️ Technical Arsenal
* **Languages:** `Rust` | `C++` | `C` | `Python` | `Java`
* **AI/ML:** Recursive HRM, MLA (Multi-Head Latent Attention), SwiGLU, Custom Tokenizers
* **Hardware & Infrastructure:** Currently diving deep into AI training hardware, GPU/CPU architecture, and compute optimization.

---

### 🧬 Featured Project: [Ouroboros-Recursive-LM](https://github.com/loki-smip/Ouroboros-Recursive-LM)
* **Architecture:** A Recursive Hierarchical Representation Model (R-HRM).
* **Innovation:** Uses 8 recursive steps to maximize reasoning depth within a compact 512-D parameter space.
* **Current Goal:** Hitting the **2.1 Loss "Sniper Target"** for optimal reasoning convergence.

### 🎨 Creative & Tech Content
Beyond coding, I experiment with digital media and technology concepts.
* **YouTube:** [just a guy who likes to Experiment](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUqNjJQs5_-tUG4z73UuPCg)
* **Interests:** Blender Animation, Video Editing, and exploring "The way of Technology of the future."
