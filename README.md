# 👋 Hi, I'm @loki-smip

### 🚀 Recursive AI Architect & Systems Administrator
I am a 14-year-old developer and sysadmin focused on efficient LLM architectures and high-performance self-hosted infrastructure. I bridge the gap between deep learning and bare-metal systems.

### 🛠️ Technical Arsenal
* **Languages:** `Rust` | `C++` | `C` | `Python` | `Java`
* **AI/ML:** Recursive HRM, MLA (Multi-Head Latent Attention), SwiGLU, Custom Tokenizers
* **Infrastructure:** Home Server Sysadmin, Docker, Local Intranet Management
* **Hardware:** Diving deep into GPU/CPU architecture and AI compute optimization.

### 🧬 Featured Project: [Ouroboros-Recursive-LM](https://github.com/loki-smip/Ouroboros-Recursive-LM)
* **Architecture:** A Recursive Hierarchical Representation Model (R-HRM).
* **Innovation:** Uses 8 recursive steps to maximize reasoning depth in a compact 512-D space.
* **Goal:** Hitting the **2.1 Loss "Sniper Target"** for optimal reasoning convergence.
